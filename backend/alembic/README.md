# Migrations are now in Supabase

This project uses **Supabase** for the database. Schema changes are applied in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Open your project on [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **SQL Editor**.
3. Run the SQL in **supabase/schema.sql** (at the repo root) to create or update tables.

Alembic is no longer used.
